# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple C++ console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game with an intelligent
algorithm to play against. The logic used for computer AI is a simple
minimax-algorithm.

Main program features can be found in the Board class inside `ristinolla.cpp` file and game logic helper functions in the `gamelogic.cpp` file.

## What I Learned
- **C++ Programming**: Gained deeper understanding of C++. Learned how to implement Artificial Intelligence in a game environment.
- **Project Structure**: Organized the project files and code in a modular and maintainable way.
